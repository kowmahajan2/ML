1. we need to create a dictionary of all the different item types and other different types of things
, to convert from a text type to some number

2. This needs to be tidied up with a final level class with the item, connection and voxel array

3. we should also consider the creation of some meta features, eg. number of items, number of connections, ratio of solid voxels vs
total voxal, stuff like that.
